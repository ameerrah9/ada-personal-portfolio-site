          I take a proactive and detailed approach to engineering software. I am
          a boot-camp graduate, full-stack web developer with a degree in
          Finance/business administration and experience managing customer
          service in the restaurant market. While attending Central State
          University to obtain my B.S., Business Administration degree, I played
          collegiate D2 basketball and led the team to a championship. Iâ€™m an
          ATL-based software engineer currently working at Office Space. My
          professional interests are back-end development and data
          visualization. I have previously worked at Popmenu and several
          startups. When not working, I enjoy watching sports and podcasting.
